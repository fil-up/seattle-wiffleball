## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Google Sheets is sole data source; Prisma/SQLite removal is Phase 1 priority
- [Roadmap]: INFRA-04 (remove Prisma) grouped with DATA requirements in Phase 1 since they're tightly coupled
- [Roadmap]: Stats visual polish (STAT-06/07/08/09) deferred to Phase 5 — accuracy before aesthetics
- [01-01]: Use SPREADSHEET_ID (not NEXT_PUBLIC_) to keep sheet ID server-side only
- [01-01]: Stub routes with 503 instead of deleting, preserving structure for Plan 01-02
- [01-02]: Regex-based gviz parsing instead of fragile substring(47)
- [01-02]: All API routes return { data, stale } envelope for uniform consumption
- [01-02]: Cache key format sheet!range to distinguish split ranges within same tab

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Codebase has 36 v1 requirements (REQUIREMENTS.md header says 32 — count should be corrected)
- No test coverage exists; refactoring in Phase 1 carries regression risk
- OneDrive sync can corrupt .next cache on Windows — delete .next before builds if errors occur
